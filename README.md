This repository contains unofficial "patches" for [@DavidXN](https://github.com/davidxn)'s various [RAMP](https://ramp.teamouse.net) projects.

These are intended to get the games to be compatible with the latest versions of GZDoom engine. **There are no fixes to individual maps that are unfinishable or otherwise broken, but do not prevent the game from running.**

On top of that, I have added the convenient "back to hub" feature from 2024 into past RAMPs.

The full patched games can be downloaded on the [Releases](../../releases) page. The release versions correspond to the versions of GZDoom they were tested on.

To maintain compatibility with your save files, overwrite your existing RAMP PK3s. Type `changemap refuge` before saving in order to make extra sure the save remains compatible, as that map is designed specifically for save transfer between RAMP versions.

In the repo, the patches themselves are presented as folders that you can add to the "official" PK3 via SLADE or an archiving program such as 7-Zip, replacing the existing files in them.
