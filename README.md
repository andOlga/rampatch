This repository contains "patches" for [@DavidXN](https://github.com/davidxn)'s various RAMP projects.
These are intended to get the games to be compatible with the latest versions of GZDoom engine.
On top of that, I have added the convenient "back to hub" feature from 2024 into past RAMPs.
The full patched games can be downloaded on the [Releases](../../releases) page.
In the repo, the patches themselves are presented as folders that you can add to the "official" PK3 via SLADE or an archiving program such as 7-Zip, replacing the existing files in them.
